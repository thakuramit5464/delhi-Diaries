              <p class="history-para">
                According to legend, the city was named for Raja Dhilu, a king
                who reigned in the region in the 1st century bce. The names by
                which the city has been known—including Delhi, Dehli, Dilli, and
                Dhilli, among others—likely are corruptions of his name.

              <p class="history-para">
                According to the 2011 census of India, the population of the NCT
                of Delhi is 16,753,235. The corresponding population density was
                11,297 persons per km2 with a sex ratio of 866 women per 1000
                men, and a literacy rate of 86.34%. In 2004, the birth rate,
                death rate and infant mortality rate per 1000 population were
                20.03, 5.59 and 13.08, respectively. In 2001, the population of
                Delhi increased by 285,000 as a result of migration and by
                215,000 as a result of natural population growth, which made
                Delhi one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Dwarka Sub
                City, Asia's largest planned residential area, is located within
                the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Urban expansion has
                resulted in Delhi's urban area now being considered as extending
                beyond the NCT boundaries to incorporate the towns and cities of
                neighbouring states including Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana,
                and Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, the total population
                of which is estimated by the United Nations to be over 28
                million. According to the UN this makes Delhi urban area the
                world's second-largest urban area after Tokyo, although
                Demographia declares the Jakarta urban area to be the
                second-largest.
